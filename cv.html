<p>The aim of this project was to develop a molecular dynamics simulation model to speed up atomistic simulations
    and still preserve the accuracy they provide. In this project, the necessary scripts are mainly written in Python
    using the Numpy library for calculations and Bash/Awk for system-side operations. Data analysis steps are
    implemented in Python, and matplotlib and seaborn libraries are used for visualization. All the simulations and
    calculations are completed on High-Performance Computing clusters available to the research center. Simulations are
    using the open-source Gromacs Molecular Dynamics software.</p>

<h4>Work Experience</h4>
<br>
<h5>Research Assistant | Koç University | COSBI Lab</h5>
<span>February 2019 - Present</span>
<br>
<p>In this project we identified experimentally determined 3-dimensional structures of protein-protein interfaces, and
    implemented several downstream tasks for analysis and prediction of protein-protein interactions. SQL and NoSQL
    databases are used for data storage, where applicable.
    Codes for this project are mainly written in Python, and available on GitHub.
    Numpy and Pandas libraries are used for calculations and analysis. Deep learning models are implemented using
    TensorFlow. Bash/Awk for system-side operations on Unix-based High Performance Computing clusters. matplotlib and
    seaborn libraries are used for visualization.</p>

<h5>Guide | inzva</h5>
<span>November 2022</span>
<br>
<p>
    I was a guide for Google Machine Learning Bootcamp held together with inzva. I instructed participants on how to
    set up their environments for using TensorFlow with GPU, and explained how to implement convolutional neural networks
    for image models in TensorFlow and Keras.

<h5>Research Assistant | Koç University | Sayar Lab</h5>
<span>September 2016 - January 2019</span>
<br>
<p>The aim of this project was to develop a molecular dynamics simulation model to speed up atomistic simulations
    and still preserve the accuracy they provide. All the simulations and
    calculations are completed on Linux based High-Performance Computing clusters available. Simulations are
    using the open-source Gromacs Molecular Dynamics software.</p>
